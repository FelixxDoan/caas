      "type": "paragraph",

Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and \nlarge screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements \nwill cause the elements to be too wide for smaller devices. \nInstead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be \ncareful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to \nfall outside the viewport on small devices."
